    "### Fill out your descriptions in this markdown cell, and your code with plots in cells below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (1) Describe the trajectory of the electron you saw from the pre-flight and explain the behavior (e.g. if you see circular and/or translational motion, why?).\n",
    "\n",
    "The electron follows a helical trajectory or a spiral path. This is because the electron experiences translational motion in the x-direction and circular motion in the y-z plane. The electric field affects the x position of the electron, and causes an acceleration along this direction. The magnetic field, on the other hand, is responsible for the circular motion in the y-z plane. Since the electron has an initial y-velocity, and the magnetic field is alligned in the x direction, it undergoes acceleration forming a circular path in the y-z plane. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### (2) Plot the kinetic energy of the particle as a function of time.  Note, you can calculate this from the returned output velocity_evolution. Describe and explain the behavior of the kinetic energy as a function of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kinetic Energy increases with time. Because the electric force is in the same direction as the x-component of the particle's velocity, there is an increase in the magnitude of the velocity of the particle. This is seen as the increase in kinetic energy. This increase is only a result of the electric field. The magnetic force due to the field does no work on the particle. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### (3) Create a new function, `constant_doubled_electric_x_field` with electric field being $\\vec{E}=[2,0,0]$, and use this to overplot the trajectory with the first trajectory.  Describe what happens when you double the strength of the E-field.\n",
    "\n",
    "This trajectory is shown by the red plot. As we expected, from question 1, the electric field increases the x-velocity of the particle. When comparing this plot to the plot of the original case, we see that in the case of the doubled electric field, the particle covers a greater distance along the x-axis. This is because, due to a greater field, the particle experiences a greater force of acceleration in this direction, and hence reaches higher velocities and travels a greater distance. The radius of the path in the yz plane however, is the same as in the original case. This is because, the velocity of the particle in the y and z directions remains the same and the magnetic field is also unchanged. However, the distance between two consecutive circles in the path has increased as a result of increased acceleration of the particle. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### (4) Create a new function, `constant_doubled_magnetic_x_field` with magnetic field being $\\vec{B}=[2,0,0]$, and use this to overplot on the previous trajectories.  Describe what happens when you double the strength of the B-field.\n",
    "\n",
    "This trajectory is shown by the green plot. As we expected, the radius of the circular path in the yz plane is smaller. This is on account of a greater magnetic force acting on the particle due to the doubled magnitude of the field. We also notice, that the green and blue (original) plots cover the same distance. This is because the electric force on the particle is the same in both cases and so is the resulting acceleration. \n"

    "\n",
    "### Fill out your descriptions in this markdown cell, and your code with plots in cells below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (1) Explain why the trajectory looks the way it does.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all three cases there is a net movement along the z - axis, while there is oscilations along the x - axis. From the initial position, the particle gets accelerated by the electric field (which is along the x axis), and gains a positive x - velocity. Due to this, the magnetic field (which is along the y - axis) exerts a force on the particle in the positive z direction. Once the particle gains a high enough velocity along the z - axis (due to the magnetic field), the effect of the field changes and the particle begins accelerating in the negative x direction. This acceleration opposes that due to the electric field. This continues until, the effect of the electric force overcomes that of the magnetic force and the cycle continues. There is no displacement along the y-axis. This is because, initially the particle has a zero y - velocity. Also, the magnetic field acts along the y direction and hence can have no effect on the displacement of the particle in this direction. The electric field also, acts along the positive x direction and hence does not affect the y velocity of the particle. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### (2) Explain why the kinetic energy look the way it does.\n",
    "\n",
    "The kinetic energy also follows a sinusoidal pattern. This is because, as the particle moves along the positive x axis, its speed first increases to a maximum then decreases due to the opposing magnetic force. The particle then moves along the negative x direction and its speed again increases due to the magnetic force and then decreases. This continues as a cycle. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (3) Describe what happens when you double the strength of the E-field.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main effects to this. One is a greater displacement along the positive x axis. This is because, the magnetic field takes a greater amount of time to oppose the effect of the doubled electric field, which causes greater acceleration in the positive x direction. This is because the particle needs to acquire a greater speed before the magnetic field can oppose the effects of the electric field. Second, the kinetic energy reaches a greater maximum. This is because on account of the increased E field, the particle undergoes greater acceleration and reaches a greater maximum velocity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (4) Describe what happens when you double the strength of the B-field.  You'll need a new function for this as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect to see an effect opposite to that when doubling the electric field. The displacement along the x axis is lesser. This because, the greater magnetic field opposes the effect of the electric field faster, and does not allow as much of a displacement to occur in the postive x direction. Additionally, since the magnetic field strength is now doubled, the field can counteract the effect of electric field at a lesser speed of the particle. Also once the particle begins accelerating in the negative x direction, the magnetic force changes at a much higher rate than in the original case allowing the effect of the electric field to dominate. As a result, the particle accelerates along each direction in half the time as it did in the other two cases (as is evident from the graph). Therefore, the particle does not reach speeds as high as in the first two cases and hence has a low kinetic energy. "
